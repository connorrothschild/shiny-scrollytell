              <br><br> 
              <p> The topic of job automation has rapidly entered the national discourse. 
              Although it was once a topic reserved for policy wonks, college students, and Reddit Libertarians, it's now a serious talking point&mdash;from 
              the multitude of news articles documenting the risk of automation, to <a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2019/09/27/automation-will-dramatically-change-the-workforce-andrew-yang-has-a-plan-to-bridge-the-gap/#52f0e5df204b' target='_blank'>Andrew Yang's presidential proposal</a> to solve job automation via a universal basic income. 
              <br> Experts have put forth a wide range of estimates for the true impact of job automization. No matter how severe it is, few argue that automation will have <i>no impact</i>.
              Most agree that automation will impact the way Americans work, and that it may put many workers out of a job (and many argue it already has).
              <br><br> But will different workers experience the impacts of automation in different ways? In this post, I combine data from two Oxford researchers, <a href='https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf' target='_blank'>Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A.

                            <span style='font-size:18px'>This data led researchers Carl Frey and Michael Osborne to predict that 47% of jobs are at serious risk of automation over the next couple decades.

                            <br>The visuals above suggest that the ills of automation may not be evenly distributed across jobs.
                            Less educated workers are more likely to face job loss as a product of automation. Those with high school diplomas or less find themself concentrated near the top of the y-axis, while those with bachelorâ€™s degrees or higher face a lower risk of automation.
                        <br>
                            <br>A jobâ€™s salary is also predictive of automation probability. As the median income of a profession increases, the likelihood of automation displacing its workers decreases.
                            This could suggest that automation will increasingly bifurcate the already divided labor market, making those at the top wealthier at the expense of the worse-off.
                        <br>
                            <br>Automationâ€™s impact on work necessitates a policy response. The fact that automation will have different effects on different industries and different workers is a reminder that this public policy will have to be strategic and thoughtful.</span></p>")

                Education is coded as typical education, meaning that the coded variable corresponds to the level of education that is most prevalent within a given occupation.
                If 51% of accountants hold a bachelor's degree, their typical education will be coded as such.
                Summary statistics for each level of education are calculated via the weighted mean of each occupation given its number of workers.
